# Lasso with d3 v4 and canvas

Example of a lasso technique using data drawn on canvas (or really anywhere) and an SVG interaction layer for drawing the lasso.

Click and drag to select nodes.

Excuse my laziness in the dist files. I coded lasso.js and script.js and then ran buble to compile them for the block.
